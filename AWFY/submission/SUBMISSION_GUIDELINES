Submission Guidelines
=====================
The SIGMOD 2014 programming contest management system accepts submissions of the 
form [all.tar.gz]. Each submission must contain the following files/directories:
- run.sh: This shell script must take two arguments: [path_to_data_directory] 
  and [path_to_query_file]. This script is responsible for running the 
  participant-prepared executable file(s) to evaluate all of the queries found 
  in [path_to_query_file] on the data found in [path_to_data_directory], and 
  printing the results to standard output (stdout).
- README: This file contains information about the submission including 
  (1) team name, (2) for each team member, name, email, institution, department, 
  and degree, (3) supervisor name (if any), (4) a brief description of techniques
  for executing queries, and (5) all of the third party code used.
- src/: This directory must contain all of the source code. The executable 
  file(s) called by run.sh must be located outside this directory.
- src/compile.sh: This shell script must be able to compile the source code 
  contained in the src/ directory. The produced executable file(s) must be 
  located within the src/ directory. These files must be equivalent to (i.e., given
  the same workload, produce the same output as) the ready-to-execute (binary) files 
  provided by the participants.

Notes: 
- Please ensure that tar -zxvf all.tar.gz places run.sh and src/ in the current 
  directory.
- Each submission must be fully open source under some license such that we can 
  publish and make the code from the finalists' implementations freely available. 
  Submissions which cannot be made freely available as open source will be 
  disqualified. 
- We request the participants to submit executable files so that their 
  implementations can be evaluated even if their submitted source code does not 
  compile on our machine (e.g., due to compatibility, access right problems).
- Before submission, please ensure that your program output for our sample graph 
  data and queries is the same as the answers we provided (except for comments 
  that begin with %). If you have a question regarding the correctness of the 
  provided answers, please contact us at SIGMOD14contest@cs.albany.edu.
